# OCR-of-Hand-written-Digits-using-CNN
OCR of Hand-written Digits using CNN. This OCR recognize the single as well as Multiple digits from a single image.

# 1 Data
This project is based on the MNIST dataset available as part of TensorFlow /
Keras datasets.
# 2 Problem Statement
Your task is to extend MNIST standard implementation to develop following
features:
  1. Gather your own data of hand-written digits (at least 200 unique sample per project)
  2. Test the MNIST implementation on your data
  3. Your program should be able to convert an image containing an integer of up to 5 digits into equivalent number. For example, 45321, 88881, 23019 etc
  4. You are free to jump to CNN implementation if required
 # 3 Deliverables and Deadline
    Your submission must include:
  1. Python source code
  2. Technical report written in Latex and clearly describing your implementation, challenges and results (including accuracy, recall, precision etc). It should also include the description and analysis of your data.
  3. Presentation (in the tool of your choice) to be presented within 10 minutes and must summarise the entire project including achievements and results
  All the deliverables need to be zipped as .zip file and uploaded over LMS under “Project-3 Submission” latest by Tuesday, December 31, 2019 11:59PM. Deadline will not be extended.
# 4 Evaluation Mode
  You will be required to present your project using the submitted presentation in the form of groups (maximum allowed size of group = 3) followed by individual
viva about all components of the project. All group members may not be ending up in the same result. This project carries 10% weight towards your final grade
of the course. In case of any queries, please feel free to consult the instructor. Also, please
do go through the “Honor Code” uploaded over LMS before your start the
project.
